# Stock Exchange Analysis

The following script will, with one run, loop through all data on all sheets and provide the following in a summary table:
  - The ticker symbol 
  - Yearly change of the price from the opening day on the first day of the year to the closing price on the last day of the year. 
  - Yearly changes greater than zero are highlighted in green while yearly changes less than zero are highlighted in red. 
  - The percent change from opening and closing price of the given year
  - The total stock volume
 
 This VBA result will also builds headings for the summary table on each new worksheet.
